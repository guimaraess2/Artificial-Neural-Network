# Artificial-Neural-Network
 Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.
Neural networks use supervised as well as unsupervised machine learning data sets and methodologies to achieve results. The supervised learning method is much more suitable and appropriate when neural networks are used for classification problems like email a spam or not spam. Often people get confused between a deep neural network which is actually an artificial neural network only with multiple layers between the input and output layers.
This work uses artificial neural networks to predict the possibility of customers staying or closing their accounts at a bank.
